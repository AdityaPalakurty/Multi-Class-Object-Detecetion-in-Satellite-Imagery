Multi-Class Object Detection in Satellite Imagery is a challenging task 
due to the large size and complexity of the images, as well as the diversity 
of objects that can be present. However, deep learning techniques have 
shown great promise for multi-class object detection in satellite imagery.
One of the most popular deep learning object detection algorithms is 
YOLO (You Only Look Once). YOLO divides the image into a grid of cells, 
and each cell predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for the 
objects that fall within its boundaries. This approach allows YOLO to 
detect objects in real time; making it a good choice for applications such 
as monitoring deforestation, tracking illegal mining, and detecting ships at 
sea. This approach allows Faster R-CNN to detect multiple objects in an 
image, each with a different class label. Other deep learning object 
detection algorithms that have been used for multi-class object detection 
in satellite imagery include Mask R-CNN, YOLOv3, and SSD. These 
algorithms have achieved high accuracy on benchmark datasets, and they 
are being used for a variety of applications. 


As deep learning techniques continue to improve, multi-class object 
detection in satellite imagery is becoming increasingly accurate and 
reliable. This is leading to new applications for satellite imagery, such as 
disaster response, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. 


Human visual system is very fast that can easily detect and identify 
the objects using this visual system it can easily identify multiple objects 
and detect the obstacle. This time there are very large amount of data, 
faster Gpu and good algorithm that we can easily train computers to 
detect and classify multiple objects with the high accuracy. In this we use 
an algorithm to detect and identify the objects that is “YOU ONLY LOOK 
ONCE” (YOLO) algorithm. This project is based on deep learning approach 
to solve the problem of object detection and recognition.

This project was accomplished by drawing insights from open literature and online resources available on the internet. I also extend my gratitude to the various websites/companies like Ultralytics,kaggle that provided valuable information, contributing to the completion of this project.
